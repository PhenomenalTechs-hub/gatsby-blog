Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the [web programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_programmer "Web programmer") at the *[Lawrence Journal-World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Journal-World "Lawrence Journal-World")* newspaper, [Adrian Holovaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Holovaty "Adrian Holovaty") and [Simon Willison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Willison "Simon Willison"), began using Python to build applications. [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Kaplan-Moss&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jacob Kaplan-Moss (page does not exist)") was hired early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended.\[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django*(web_framework)#cite_note-19) It was released publicly under a [BSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license "BSD license") in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt "Django Reinhardt").\[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django*(web_framework)#cite_note-Django's_History-20) Adrian Holovaty is a Romani jazz guitar player and a big fan of Django Reinhardt.

In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed [Django Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Software_Foundation "Django Software Foundation") (DSF) would maintain Django in the future.\[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)#cite_note-21)
